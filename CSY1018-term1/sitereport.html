		In the 1st term of first semester we learn about the basic of web designing (HTML and CSS). First of all in collage, we were taught about the github and how to use it. Github is used by the developers all over the world. We first create repository in github . an repository is a location where all the files for the particular project is stored. That repository can later be accessed through anywhere anytime through any devices. Github can be used by the team of the developers working on the same project if you have a team that is constantly making changes to the code. We were then taught about the basic in HTML, about the div, headers, footer, h1-h6, selectors, box model and so on. Box model is the feature of the chrome developer tools, it consist of margins, borders, padding, and actual contents.  And H1-H6 are the pre programmed headings with there unique fonts, and there default margins. Whereas,  header, footer are the sections as there names suggest. And div creates the section whose height, width, background color can be changes accordingly. While learning all this all, it was a  bit harder to understand at once but in the tutorial class it makes a lot easier to understand as we get to use those knowledge practically. We then learned about the CSS, positioning, and creating responsive web design using media queries. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS file is created separately and then linked into the HTML file. CSS is mostly used for making changes in the HTML files. Using CSS, we can change the default values of the given tags and even make the changes as per we want. With CSS, we can make 3d design and create animations like moving the images, changing colors and so on.

	<p class="report">
		The way the course is designed makes it a lot easier to understand the courses. Throughout this term. overall, I enjoyed this module and look forward to learn even more. At the starting, it was bit harder to learn it but the tutorial class has helped as we get to use it practically in proper supervision of the teachers. Even after the class were shifted online due to current condition the proper management of classes has helped us to learn in good environment. I feel even in online classes I have learnt a lot. My Skills has improved considerably since beginning.
